Job Portal Application
🚀 Overview
This is a full-stack Job Portal Application designed to connect job seekers with employers. It provides functionalities for both client-side job searching and application and server-side management of companies, users, and job listings, including file uploads via Multer.

The project is structured with a clear separation between the client-side front-end (likely a React application) and the server-side back-end (Node.js/Express).
